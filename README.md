# PaSST: Efficient Training of Audio Transformers with Patchout


This is the implementation for [Efficient Training of Audio Transformers with Patchout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05069)

Patchout significantly reduces the training time and GPU memory requirements to train transformers on audio spectrograms, while improving their performance.

Patchout works by dropping out some of the input patches during training. In either a unstructured way (randomly, similar to dropout), or entire time-frames or frequency bins of the extracted patches (similar to SpecAugment), which corresponds to rows/columns in step 3 of the figure below.

## Pre-trained models for Inference and embeddings extractions

If you only want to use the embeddings generated by the pretrained models, use your own fine-tuning framework, or you need it only for inference, you can find a stripped down version of this repo [here](https://github.com/kkoutini/passt_hear21). 
The package follows [HEAR 2021 NeurIPS Challenge](https://neuralaudio.ai/hear2021-results.html) API, and can be installed:
 
```shell
pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/kkoutini/passt_hear21@0.0.17#egg=hear21passt' 
```
This repo is a complete framework for training the models and fine-tuning pre-trained models on Audioset on downstream tasks.



### Getting the logits from the pretrained models 
```python
from hear21passt.base import get_basic_model,get_model_passt
import torch
# get the PaSST model wrapper, includes Melspectrogram and the default pre-trained transformer
model = get_basic_model(mode="logits")
print(model.mel) # Extracts mel spectrogram from raw waveforms.
print(model.net) # the transformer network.

# example inference
model.eval()
model = model.cuda()
with torch.no_grad():
    # audio_wave has the shape of [batch, seconds*32000] sampling rate is 32k
    # example audio_wave of batch=3 and 10 seconds
    audio = torch.ones((3, 32000 * 10))*0.5
    audio_wave = audio.cuda()
    logits=model(audio_wave) 
```

### Getting a pre-trained model for fine tuning

```python
from hear21passt.base import get_basic_model,get_model_passt
import torch
# get the PaSST model wrapper, includes Melspectrogram and the default pre-trained transformer
model = get_basic_model(mode="logits")
print(model.mel) # Extracts mel spectrogram from raw waveforms.

# optional replace the transformer with one that has the required number of classes i.e. 50
model.net = get_model_passt(arch="passt_s_swa_p16_128_ap476",  n_classes=50)
print(model.net) # the transformer network.


# now model contains mel + the transformer pre-trained model ready to be fine tuned.
# It's still expecting input of the shape [batch, seconds*32000] sampling rate is 32k

model.train()
model = model.cuda()

```

## Development environment
If you want to use the same environment as in the paper, you can follow the instructions below.

### Setting up the development experiments environment

For training models from scratch or fine-tuning using the same setup as in the paper:

1. If needed, create a new environment with python 3.8 and activate it:

```bash
conda create -n passt python=3.8
conda activate passt
 ```

2. Install pytorch build that suits your system. For example:

```bash
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

 ```

3. Install the requirements:

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

### Setting up using the exported conda environment

Alternatively, you can use the exported conda environment `environment.yml` to create the environment.

For setting up [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is recommended since it works faster than `conda`:

```shell
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```
Now you can import the environment from `environment.yml`
```shell
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
Now you have an environment named `ba3l`.

### Checking the environment

In order to check if your environment matched the environment we used in our runs, please check the `environment.yml` and `pip_list.txt` files, which were exported using:

```shell
conda env export --no-builds | grep -v "prefix" > environment.yml
pip list > pip_list.txt
```

## Getting started 
If you want to use your setup and only use the models from this repo, you can get the models train them from scratch or fine-tune them on your own dataset as explained above [Pre-trained models for Inference and embeddings extractions](#pre-trained-models-for-inference-and-embeddings-extractions). The rest of this section explains using this repo for training and fine-tuning the models. For that, first you need to set up the development environment as explained above.

### General information
The repo is built using [sacred](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/) for experiment management and configuration, pytorch-lightning for training, and wandb for logging.

Each dataset has a main experiment file such as `ex_audioset.py` and `ex_openmic.py` and a dataset folder. The experiment file contains the main training and validation logic. The dataset folder contains the dataset specific code needed to download, preprocess and load the dataset for training.

In general, you can prob the experiment file for help, this will print the available commands and basic options:

```shell
python ex_audioset.py help
```

### Configuring the experiment

Each experiment has a set of default configuration options, defined in the experiment file, e.g. `ex_audioset.py`. You can override any of the configuration using the [sacred syntax](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html). You can use the `print_config` command to print the configuration values without training a model:

```shell
 python ex_audioset.py print_config
 ```
You can use then use the command line interface to override any of the configuration options ([sacred syntax](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html)), using `with` e.g.:

```shell
python ex_audioset.py with trainer.precision=16 
```

This will train on audioset using 16-bit precision.


The overall configurations look like this:
```yaml
  ...
  seed = 542198583                  # the random seed for this experiment
  slurm_job_id = ''
  speed_test_batch_size = 100
  swa = True
  swa_epoch_start = 50
  swa_freq = 5
  use_mixup = True
  warm_up_len = 5
  weight_decay = 0.0001
  basedataset:
    base_dir = 'audioset_hdf5s/'     # base directory of the dataset, change it or make a link
    eval_hdf5 = 'audioset_hdf5s/mp3/eval_segments_mp3.hdf'
    wavmix = 1
    ....
    roll_conf:
      axis = 1
      shift = None
      shift_range = 50
  datasets:
    test:
      batch_size = 20
      dataset = {CMD!}'/basedataset.get_test_set'
      num_workers = 16
      validate = True
    training:
      batch_size = 12
      dataset = {CMD!}'/basedataset.get_full_training_set'
      num_workers = 16
      sampler = {CMD!}'/basedataset.get_ft_weighted_sampler'
      shuffle = None
      train = True
  models:
    mel:
      freqm = 48
      timem = 192
      hopsize = 320
      htk = False
      n_fft = 1024
      n_mels = 128
      norm = 1
      sr = 32000
      ...
    net:
      arch = 'passt_s_swa_p16_128_ap476'
      fstride = 10
      in_channels = 1
      input_fdim = 128
      input_tdim = 998
      n_classes = 527
      s_patchout_f = 4
      s_patchout_t = 40
      tstride = 10
      u_patchout = 0
      ...
  trainer:
    accelerator = None
    accumulate_grad_batches = 1
    amp_backend = 'native'
    amp_level = 'O2'
    auto_lr_find = False
    auto_scale_batch_size = False
    ...
```
There are many things that can be updated from the command line.
In short:

- All the configuration options under `trainer` are pytorch lightning trainer [api](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/1.4.1/common/trainer.html#trainer-class-api). For example, to turn off cuda benchmarking add `trainer.benchmark=False` to the command line.
- `wandb` is the wandb configuration. For example, to change the wandb project `wandb.project="test_project"` to the command line.
- `models.net` are the PaSST (or the chosen NN) options. Examples: `models.net.u_patchout`,  `models.net.s_patchout_f` `models.net.s_patchout_t` control the unstructured patchout and structured patchout over frequency and time. `input_fdim` and `input_tdim` are the input spectrogram dimensions over frequency and time. `models.net.fstride` and `models.net.tstride` are the strides of the input patches over frequency and time, setting these to 16 means no patch overlap.
- `models.mel` are the preprocessing options (mel spectrograms). `mel.sr` is the sampling rate, `mel.hopsize` is the hop size of the STFT window, `mel.n_mels` is the number of mel bins, `mel.freqm` and `mel.timem` are the frequency and time masking parameters of spec-augment.

There are many pre-defined configuration bundles (called named_configs) in `config_updates.py`. These include different models, setups etc...
You can list these configurations with:

```shell
python ex_audioset.py print_named_configs
```

For example, `passt_s_20sec` is a configuration bundle that sets the model to PaSST-S pre-trained on Audioset, and accepts up to 20 second clips.

## Training on Audioset

Download and prepare the dataset as explained in the [audioset page](audioset/)

The base PaSST model can be trained for example like this:
```bash
python ex_audioset.py with trainer.precision=16  models.net.arch=passt_deit_bd_p16_384 -p
```

For example using only unstructured patchout of 400:

```bash
python ex_audioset.py with trainer.precision=16  models.net.arch=passt_deit_bd_p16_384  models.net.u_patchout=400  models.net.s_patchout_f=0 models.net.s_patchout_t=0 -p
```

Multi-gpu training can be enabled by setting the environment variable `DDP`, for example with 2 gpus:

```shell
 DDP=2 python ex_audioset.py with trainer.precision=16  models.net.arch=passt_deit_bd_p16_384 -p -c "PaSST base 2 GPU"
```


## Examples with Pre-trained models

Please check the [releases page](https://github.com/kkoutini/PaSST/releases/), to download pre-trained models. 
In general, you can get a pretrained model on Audioset using 
```python
from models.passt import get_model
model  = get_model(arch="passt_s_swa_p16_128_ap476", pretrained=True, n_classes=527, in_channels=1,
                   fstride=10, tstride=10,input_fdim=128, input_tdim=998,
                   u_patchout=0, s_patchout_t=40, s_patchout_f=4)
```

this will get automatically download pretrained PaSST on audioset with with mAP of ```0.476```. the model was trained with ```s_patchout_t=40, s_patchout_f=4``` but you can change these to better fit your task/ computational needs.

There are several pretrained models availble with different strides (overlap) and with/without using SWA: `passt_s_p16_s16_128_ap468, passt_s_swa_p16_s16_128_ap473, passt_s_swa_p16_s14_128_ap471, passt_s_p16_s14_128_ap469, passt_s_swa_p16_s12_128_ap473, passt_s_p16_s12_128_ap470`. 
For example, In `passt_s_swa_p16_s16_128_ap473`: `p16` mean patch size is `16x16`, `s16` means no overlap (stride=16), 128 mel bands, `ap473` refers to the performance of this model on Audioset mAP=0.479.

In general, you can get a pretrained model using:

```python
from models.passt import get_model
passt = get_model(arch="passt_s_swa_p16_s16_128_ap473", fstride=16, tstride=16)
```

Using the framework, you can evaluate this model using:

```shell
python ex_audioset.py evaluate_only with  trainer.precision=16  passt_s_swa_p16_s16_128_ap473 -p
```

Ensemble of these models are provided as well:
A large ensemble giving `mAP=.4956`

```shell
python ex_audioset.py evaluate_only with  trainer.precision=16 ensemble_many
```

An ensemble of 2 models with `stride=14` and `stride=16` giving `mAP=.4858`

```shell
python ex_audioset.py evaluate_only with  trainer.precision=16 ensemble_s16_14
```

As well as other ensembles `ensemble_4`, `ensemble_5`
